# Libstorm
Simple C++ framework aimed for my ease of use. I made it open-source so anyone else that wants to use it can.

## How to use

Add the directory of the lib to your CMake project and include it using add_subdirectory.

## Requirements

### Windows

- Install the SDL2, SDL2-image, SDL2-ttf packages from [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) and change the vcpkg path / build type to suit your needs.

### Unix

- libsdl2-dev for Ubuntu, sdl2 for Arch.
- libsdl2-ttf-dev for Ubuntu, sdl2_ttf for Arch.
- libsdl2-img-dev for Ubuntu, sdl2_img for Arch.

### PSVita

- [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/)
